Instructions to run the program minesweeper.cpp
1. Download the minsweeper.cpp file from the drive.
2. Run the program.
3. Input the rows, columns and mine probability values from the user.
	Example: rows (max. 100) = 7, cols (max. 100) = 7, mine probability (max. 100) = 25
4. The rows and cols define the grid size to generate the mines.
5. The mine probability value defines the number of mines per 100 grids placed.
6. The mineGenerator function automatically generates the input field based on the user values.
7. The input field is used to feed the mineSolver as an input.
